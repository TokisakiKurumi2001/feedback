###Article: (CNN)French striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who has a history of fainting, said he is now "feeling well" after collapsing during Swansea's 3-2 loss at Tottenham in the Premier League on Wednesday. The worrying incident occurred in the first half at White Hart Lane -- after Tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment. The Guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask. Play was temporarily stopped before resuming. As the match progressed, Swansea tweeted that Gomis was "fine," with manager Garry Monk using the same word to describe Gomis' condition. Gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution, Swansea said on its website. "I wanted to reassure you concerning my health," Gomis told the website. "It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. "I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health, which requires me to go back and forth from France. "I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight, but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages." Gomis had similar fainting spells in France, which prompted the president of his former club, Jean-Michel Aulas of Lyon, to tell French television in 2009: "We can't not be worried, it scares you each time." Swansea ran tests on Gomis, said Monk, prior to signing him on a free transfer last July. "He just has a little bit of low blood pressure which causes you a little bit of problems," Monk said in a televised interview on Sky. "It's been part of his life. We were well aware of that when we signed him. He's done all the hospital checks and all the medical checks you can possibly do and it's just part of his life. "It's no problems whatsoever. It's not as serious as it looks." Gomis has scored two league goals for Swansea this season, mostly in a backup role. He became the Welsh side's top striker when Wilfried Bony signed with Manchester City in January. Almost exactly three years ago at White Hart Lane, then Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest. He was near death, according to Bolton, but survived after being treated at the London Chest Hospital. He subsequently retired. Other footballers, including Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe in 2003 and Spanish international Antonio Puerta in 2007, didn't survive after collapsing on the pitch.

###Article: (CNN)Manchester United defender Jonny Evans and Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse have been charged by the Football Association for allegedly spitting during an altercation in Wednesday night's Premier League game at St James' Park. In a statement, English football's governing body said the players had been charged "in relation to an alleged breach of FA Rule E1[a] in that in or around the 38th minute of the game the two players spat at each other. "The incidents were not seen by the match officials but [were] caught on video." The players have until 6pm GMT on Friday to respond to the charge, and could face six-game bans if found guilty. Both Evans and Cisse released statements the day after the incident, with Evans saying: "I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse." Cisse's statement said: "I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be positive a role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down." Spitting at another player is considered beyond the pale by professional footballers, and former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann, now a TV pundit, told the BBC's Match of the Day programme the incident had been "disgusting." "This is not acceptable," he said. "There are kids watching. Something has to be done. The behaviour towards each other and the referee is deteriorating on a weekly basis." Ex-Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes said he did not believe Evans had deliberately spat at Cisse, telling BT Sport: "Look, it's not very nice. I think Jonny is spitting on the floor. "I know Jonny -- he's not that type of person. If he wants to do that then it's not hard to miss, is it? He's only stood a yard away from him. What Cisse does afterwards is unforgivable." And former Liverpool player Steve McManaman told the channel: "Cisse stands up and spits right at Jonny Evans' neck from about six inches. It's absolutely disgusting. "Two wrongs do not make a right. If Jonny Evans has spat at him then it's wrong, but for Papiss Cisse to get up and react like that is absolutely disgusting. We talk about bad tackles, but that is worse."

###Article: (CNN)Real Madrid fell to a lacklustre 1-0 defeat at the hands of Athletic Bilbao Saturday, potentially handing the La Liga advantage to arch rival Barcelona. A stunning header from Aritz Aduriz shortly before half time was enough to win the day for an organized and impressive Bilbao. Real piled on the pressure for much of the second half but couldn't find a way past a staunch opponent despite finishing the match with four strikers on the park. Gareth Bale struck a post with an extraordinary shot from close to the halfway line as full time approached while Arduriz almost doubled Bilbao's lead with another headed chance late on. The result means second placed Barca can now take top spot should it win at home to mid-table Rayo Vallecano Sunday. Of more immediate concern to Real boss Carlo Ancelotti after the game, however, was his side's lack of cutting edge. "I think the problem we are having at the moment is quite clear," Ancelotti told reporters. "We are not finding a way through like we did in the games before. We've only scored one goal, from a penalty, in two games. "That is the problem we have to fix. We lack efficiency up front." Real are now without a win in two league games while the 4-0 February hammering at the hands of city rivals Atletico Madrid, the clubs biggest derby defeat since 1947, is still fresh in the memory. With the second El Classico fixture of the season against Barcelona only a fortnight away, Ancelotti is looking for a quick fix to his side's attacking inhibitions. However, such worries are of little concern to a Bilbao side celebrating its first win over Real in five years. After a slow start to the season the Basques are now up to eighth position. "We are very proud of how hard we worked," goalscorer Arduriz said in comments carried by the AFP news agency. "The three points will prove a huge boost." "The fans have enjoyed it a lot and they deserved that after the poor performances at San Mames earlier in the season." Bayern Munich continued its seemingly inexorable march to a third consecutive Bundesliga title with a come from behind 3-1 victory away to Hannover. Hiroshi Kiyotake gave the hosts a surprise lead after 25 minutes but Xabi Alonso levelled shortly after. A second half brace from Thomas Muller ensured the Bavarians would increase their league at the top of the Bundesliga to 11 points as second place Wolfsburg fell to a 1-0 defeat at Augsburg. Elsewhere Saturday, Borussia Dortmund's winning streak came to an end with as Jurgen Klopp's revitalized side were held to a 0-0 draw with Hamburg. Paris Saint Germain returned to the top of the Ligue 1 table, for 24 hours at least, with a convincing 4-1 win over Lens at the Parc de Princes. David Luiz opened the scoring as the first half came to a close before Zlatan Ibrahimovic doubled the Parisian's advantage from the penalty spot on the hour mark. Substitutes Blaise Matuidi and Javier Pastore secured the win after Yoann Touzghar had pulled one back deficit for Lens. Lyon will return to the Ligue 1 summit should it dispose of Montpelier Sunday.
